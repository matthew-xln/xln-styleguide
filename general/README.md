## Table of Contents 
  1. [The Golden Rule](#the-golden-rule)
  2. [Filenames](#filenames)

## The Golden Rule
Follow the style of the file you're in. It's more important to be contextually correct than it is to be absolutely correct.

## Filenames
Filenames should be **lower-case** and **hyphen-delimited**

```css
my-directory/
|
|– my-directory-sub/
|   |– my-file.css    
```
